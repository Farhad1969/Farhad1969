### "Apache Kafka to create a data streaming platform"

The project involves setting up Apache Kafka and a PostgreSQL database encapsulated in a single or multiple Docker containers with docker-compose to establish a streamlined data streaming platform. Utilize Python to fetch data from an external source, format it for Kafka ingestion (Topics), and configure producers for efficient data transfer into Kafka topics. Python-based Kafka consumers will perform some EDA using Jupyter notebook, process and validate the data before storing it into PostgreSQL, utilizing a predefined schema. The goal is to create a reliable system that seamlessly downloads, processes, and securely stores external data in real-time using Kafka as the intermediary, Python for logic handling, and Docker for deployment flexibility.
